            <h5>Hey Lex </h5>
            <p>Being honest with you lex, I didn’t think I’d ever been as good and close as a friend with you as I could’ve imagined 4 years ago. Like “Oh that’s Sydney’s sister, damn she likes things I like but Sydney doesn’t like those things.” That was what I thought when I first started getting to know you. All of that now seems like a blur compared to what’s happened and what’s going to happen in the future. Hell the fact that I know so much about your life and everything that’s happened between us and all the things that have happened to the people we both know, It’s been a wild ride. But it’s only gonna get better from here. I promise you that. I know that you and Patrick are having a rough Patch with the distance and I’m sure he’d rather be in the city than IIT sometimes, but time flies fast when you’re having fun, so make the best out of the 4 years so that finally we can all rejoice and just have fun together, and figure out how to get Derek back from Nevada. I can truly say that you’re really like a sister to me. I already have one but you’re like a second sister I never had. You’ve never been worthless to me, you’ve meant so much to my life that I’d be a sad boi literally forever if I found out you were gone. I know you’re going to go on and do really great things and college is gonna be a bitch but it’s all going to be done with soon enough, and I promise that I’m gonna be here for you as long as I can keep my heart running for the better tomorrow. Stay safe and stay alive for Pat, Derek, and me. - Luis</p>
