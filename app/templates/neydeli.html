            <h5>Hey Neydeli </h5>
            <p>Not gonna hold you, I’m honestly surprised that we became the friends we are now from what happened. I still feel bad about all that crap I wrote in that one letter that I still wonder to this day if you have it. But beyond that, you’re such a kind and sweet person, like deadass. You’ve been so nice to me when I feel like I don’t even deserve your attention and you’ve listened to me when everyone else would rear their heads to pay attention to everything and everyone else. You’ve been such a great person when I felt like I was the most annoying person alive to you. Heck even now, with you all happy and supportive about Nickole and I, I honestly have no idea what I did to deserve your kindness. I know you’ll go on to do great things and teach the future leaders of tomorrow all the math they need to know, or y’know, dance your heart out. Maybe even both, who knows? But in the end, I’m always going to be here for you if anything happens. You’ve been so much of a good friend to me that I don’t even know how I could possibly return the favor, I’d say curry, but even then, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. I’ve truly enjoyed all of the crap we’ve talked about and all the kpop stuff you’ve taught me and all the tea we’ve spilled together and the stuff we both worked through between us, and hopefully there’ll be more where that comes from. But until then, stay alive, keep on doing them quicc maths and being awesome. 

P.S. I still want to get curry >:^(</p>
