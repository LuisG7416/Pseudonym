            <h5>Hey Luke </h5>
            <p>You're probably wondering that if you’re reading this, “Why did Luis send me a weird code phrase to this weird website?” Well, it’s for a good reason I promise. Man, I didn’t even think you’d ever want to become an actor but you are taking that path with strides! All the stuff I’ve seen about you I’ve watched too many times because it’s like “Woah, that’s my friend on a big screen with a crapload of views!” and it’s just mindboggling sometimes. We’ve gone from talking about star wars and girls and a bunch of other stuff to you becoming the next Robert Downey Jr. or something, absolutely wicked. I know we haven’t hung out much in recent times, but I’ve always hoped for some kind of ‘reunion’ or something, cause no cap, I miss you, man. I miss the stupid stuff we’ve said and made up like “Oh mannnnn” if you remember. All those crazy moments from your bday to those times with Leo Wessel to our double date that one time, it’s been crazy. But I honestly hope for the best for you. No matter where your journey takes you, I know you’ll succeed and excel wherever you go. If you want, you can use this as a motivation booster of sorts if you want. I’m always going to be here. Keep in touch, Skywalker - Lewie </p>            </div>
